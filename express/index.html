            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
              I'm Mohamad Salehi and studying Digital Media at the University of
              Bremen. I'm doing my master thesis at the digital media lab (TZI)
              and this research study is about a voice assistant helping the user
              to follow instructions during an already defined procedure. In
              this research study, you will interact with three prototypes, and
              It will take around 30 minutes of your time. <br />
              In case of any issues or further questions  you can reach me out
              through <a href="mailto:mohamadz@uni-bremen.de">mohamadz@uni-bremen.de</a>   <br />Thanks in advance for your
              participation.
            </p>
            <h5>Data storage agreement</h5>
            <p>
              Consent for Participation and anonymous Data Storage: I certify
              that I have read this document and am well-informed about this
              experiment's motivation and procedure. I agree that the data
              resulting from my participation in this study will be subject to
              anonymous scientific analysis and publication. I am aware that all
              data are processed and analyzed without using my name and are only
              collected using a participant ID (if applicable). I am aware that
              my participation in this study is voluntary and that I may
              withdraw from participation at any time without explicit reason
              and with no further consequences. Already collected data will then
              be deleted, and no connection to my person is further possible. In
              the case of anonymized data storage, my data cannot be deleted at
              my request. I agree that my data is stored after the end of the
              study and will be deleted at the latest after 10 years as far as
              legal requirements donâ€™t demand longer archiving periods.
